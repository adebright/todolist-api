<h2><strong>About the Repository</strong></h2>
Learn how to build RESTful API using MongoDB , Express , Mongoose, Node , etc.
REpresentational State Transfer is a design architecture that defines how applications communicate over HTTP.
Applications that uses REST are loosely coupled , and transfer information efficiently .
